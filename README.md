# Vendor-Selection-using-Clustering-in-Python
Built a k-means clustering model to select top 3 best vendors.

This was a case study in which the dataset consisted of Vendor Idâ€™s and the parameters like cost, quality, warranty claims, etc. offered by each vendor for a particular component. Built a k-means clustering model to select top 3 best vendors from these vendors so that the manufacturing department will get best quality products by optimizing the different vendor selection parameters.
This model was built in Python using sklearn.
